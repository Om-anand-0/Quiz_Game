Many beginners encounter difficulties in transitioning from theoretical understanding to practical application in the realm of programming. The lack of interactive tools that reinforce learning through immediate feedback and user engagement contributes to this challenge. Aspiring programmers need a platform that not only tests their knowledge but also provides a real-time assessment of their understanding, fostering a more effective learning process.
